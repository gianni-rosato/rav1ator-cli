# Farewell!

Hey everyone,

As of 26 Jan 2025, I have marked rAV1ator CLI as a public archive on GitHub & I am passing off the torch to a community member. I've been working on this project for a while, and I'm happy with what it has become, but I don't have the time to maintain it anymore. Luckily, a community member has stepped up to take over the project, and I'm excited to see where they take it!

I'd like to formally welcome the new maintainer, @ultimaxx. Updates from this repo's script won't automatically come from their fork, so you'll need to re-install rAV1ator CLI from their fork.

## New Fork

@ultimaxx fork: https://github.com/ultimaxx/rav1ator-cli

Thanks for all the support, and I hope you continue to enjoy rAV1ator CLI! Please direct any questions or concerns to @ultimaxx.
